# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

Welcome to the "0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions" directory! This directory documents my exploration of Python's conditional statements, loops, and functions during my studies at ALX School. Here, you'll find solutions to exercises and assignments that focus on these foundational concepts in Python programming.
