# 0x07-python-test_driven_development
Welcome to the "0x07-python-test_driven_development" directory! In this project, we focus on the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements and functions as expected.
