# 0x0F Python - Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
Welcome to the "0x0F Python - Object Relational Mapping" repository! This project focuses on learning and implementing Object Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques in Python. ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.

## Overview
The "0x0F Python - Object Relational Mapping" repository contains scripts, programs, and documentation to help you understand and apply ORM concepts in Python. By exploring this repository, you will learn how to interact with databases using Python's ORM libraries, such as SQLAlchemy, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database entities.
